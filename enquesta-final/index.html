						<h6> Question 4</h6>
						<p class="r-fit-text">
							In August 1974, the CIA published a report on a problem which they pointed out could lead to political unrest and mass migration. 
							According to the article, this problem started way back in the 1960s and was believed to be the cause of food shortages in India 
							and Russia in the 1960s, and later in Japan, Honduras and the Philippines. As the Western world saw a period of growth in the fields 
							of medicine, energy and technology, this report went unnoticed. What was this report about, which has generated wide interest in recent years?
